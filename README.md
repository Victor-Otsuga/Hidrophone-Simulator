### The wires represents:
+ ðŸ”´ the passage of 5V power.
+ ðŸŸ¢ the direct power flow from the sensor.
+ âš« the passage of energy to ground.

### How does it work
The esp connects to wifi and waits for a trigger to make a MQTT post passing thru a Node-RED flow and then posting on the project's API indicating the location, its function is to report movement and based on this information the project's backend in python generates a map of reports, when the project is running a sound sensor (Hydrophone) will be attached instead of a motion sensor and a GPS to inform the location in real time

### Node-RED flow

### How to run the application:
1) Click: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fMj0DPhAl9r
2) Click on "Start Simulation"
3) Wait until ESP32 connect to internet
4) Click on pir-motion-sensor to ping a trigger
5) Done the MQTT post has been done
